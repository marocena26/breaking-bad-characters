## 📝 Requirements

With a **'Adalab Web Starter Kit' template** as the starter point, the exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following **elements**:

- **HTML 5**
- **Sass**
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid**
- **Media queries**
- **Javascript**
- **Interactions with the user**
- **API request**


The following **requirements** have to be respected:

#### Design:

Design with a basic structure made on a previously given model. It must have:
- text input and search button to filter characters by their name.
- as well as a list of articles with the photo, name and status of each character. 
- additional favorites section should appear in the aside.

#### Initial state:

- When **loading the page**, all **characters** must **appear** in the main section, using an API request to obtain all the data. The URL for the request is **[The Breaking Bad API](https://breakingbadapi.com/)**. 
- For **each character** obtained in the result, a card with the following information must be **rendered**: **photo**, **name** and **status** (dead or alive).

#### Search input: 

The user can **search characters by their name**, filling the input and clicking in the 'Search' button of the form, the application should only display those characters that match the search query.

#### Favorites:

The user can **designate favorite characters**. When doing so, the following steps must occur:
- **Change styles of the selected character** card to show it has been tagged as favorite.
- **Show a list of favorite characters** in the aside with different CSS styles.
- The **favorite characters must continue to appear** even if the user executes a new search by name

#### Local Storage: 

All **characters tagged as favorite** must be **saved in localStorage**, so when the page is refreshed they do not disappear.

#### Bonus

- **Delete icon in favorites**. 
- **Highlight favorites**. 
- **General delete button**.

## 💾 Steps to follow to use this project on your computer:

> **NOTE:** This project has been carried out using **Adalab Starter Kit**.

**First** of all, in order to have the repository on your computer:

1. Click on the top right corner > **Fork**.
2. It will ask you to choose which GitHub user you want to fork it to. **Choose your user**.
3. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
4. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.

Once you have **done the fork**:

1. Open it in your code editor.
2. Open a terminal and **install the local dependencies** by executing in the command terminal. Here are the ones I used to start my project:

```bash
npm install
```

The project has to be **started** every time we start programming, to do this we will execute the **command**:

```bash
npm start
```
After running `npm start` we can start editing all the files inside the src/ folder and program comfortably 💫
